<p>I’ve started preparing these guides across various topics. I’ve done this at some of the places I’ve worked, and they seem pretty useful. I use these as a handy reference to technical topics.</p>
<p>These are rough notes, not really meant for public consumption (but who even reads this blog?). Parts of these guides will probably end up as blog posts.</p>
<p>Guides:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/1/07/hitchikers-guide-to-inferential-statistics/">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Inferential Statistics</a></li>
<li><a href="/1/07/islr-notes">ISLR Notes</a></li>
<li><a href="/1/07/moment-generating-functions">Moment Generating Functions</a></li>
</ul>
