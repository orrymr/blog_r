I've started preparing these guides across various topics. I've done this at some of the places I've worked, and they seem pretty useful. I use these as a handy reference to technical topics.

These are rough notes, not really meant for public consumption (but who even reads this blog?). Parts of these guides will probably end up as blog posts.

Guides:


- [The Hitchhiker's Guide to Inferential Statistics](/1/07/hitchikers-guide-to-inferential-statistics/)
- [ISLR Notes](/1/07/islr-notes)
- [Moment Generating Functions](/1/07/moment-generating-functions)
