# 1. Introduction
In this post we discuss the [H2O machine learning platform.](https://www.h2o.ai/) We talk about what H2O is, and how to get started with it, using R - we create a Random Forest which we use to classify the Iris Dataset.

# 2. What is H2O?

__The definition found on [H2O's Github page](https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3) is a lot to take in,__ especially if you're just starting out with H2O: "H2O is an in-memory platform for distributed, scalable machine learning. H2O uses familiar interfaces like R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON and the Flow notebook/web interface, and works seamlessly with big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark."

We spend the rest of section 2 as well as section 3 discussing salient points of the above definition.

## 2.1 H2O is an In-Memory Platform

H2O is an "in-memory platform". __Saying that it's in-memory means that the data being used is loaded into main memory (RAM).__ Reading from main memory, (also known as primary memory) is typically much faster than secondary memory (such as a hard drive). 

H2O is a "platform." __A platform is software which can be used to build something - in this case, machine learning models.__ 

Putting this togther we now know that H2O is an in-memory environment for building machine learning models.

## 2.2 H2O is Distributed and Scalable

__H2O can be run on a cluster.__ [Hadoop](https://hadoop.apache.org/) is an example of a cluster which can run H2O.

H2O is said to be distributed because your object can be spread amongst several nodes in your cluster. H2O does this by using a Distributed Key Value (DKV). You can read more about it [here](https://www.h2o.ai/blog/h2o-architecture/), but essentially what this means, is that __any object you create in H2O can be distributed amongst several nodes in the cluster.__ 

The key-value part of DKV means that when you load data into H2O, you get back a key into a hashmap containing your (potentially distributed) object.

# 3. How H2O Runs Under the Hood

We spoke earlier about H2O being a platform. __It's important to distinguish between the R interface for H2O, and H2O itself.__ H2O can exist perfectly fine without R. H2O is just a [.jar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)) which can be run on its own. If you don't know (or particularly care) what a .jar is - just think of it as Java code packaged with all the stuff you need in order to run it.

When you start H2O, you actually create a server which can respond to [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) calls. Again, you don't really need to know how REST works in order to use H2O. But if you do care, just know that __you can use any HTTP client to speak with an H2O instance.__

R is just a client interfact for H2O. All the R functions you call when working with H2O are actually calling H2O using a REST API (a JSON POST request) under the hood. The Python H2O library, as well as the [Flow UI](https://www.h2o.ai/blog/introducing-flow/), interface with H2O in a similar way. __If this is all very confusing just think about it like this: you use R to send commands to H2O. You could equally well just use Flow or Python to send commands.__

# 4. Running An Example

## 4.1 Installing H2O

You can install H2O using R: `install.packages("h2o")`. If you're having trouble with this, [have a look here.](http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-xia/2/index.html)

## 4.2 Starting H2O and Loading Data

First we'll need to load the packages we'll be using: `h2o` and `datasets`. We load the latter as we'll be using the famous [Iris Dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set), which is part of the `datasets` package.

```{r echo=T, results='hide', message = FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(h2o)
```
The Iris Dataset contains attributes of three species of iris flowers.

Let's load the iris dataset, and start up our H2O instance:

```{r echo=T, results='hide'}
h2o.init(nthreads = -1) 
data(iris)
```
By default, H2O starts up using 2 cores. By calling `h2o.init(nthreads = -1)`, with `nthreads = -1`, we use all available cores.

Edit: it doesn't default to two cores anymore (as per this tweet from H2O's chief ML scientist):

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Nice post!  BTW, H2O in R no longer defaults to 2 cores, so you can just do `h2o.init()` now. :-)</p>&mdash; Erin LeDell (@ledell) <a href="https://twitter.com/ledell/status/1075444885296168962?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 19, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


If `h2o.init()` was succesful, you should have an instance of H2O running locally! You can verify this by navigating to http://localhost:54321. There, you should see the Flow UI.

The iris dataset is now loaded into R. However, it's not yet in H2O. Let's go ahead and load the iris data into our H2O instance:

```{r echo=T, results='hide', message = FALSE}
iris.hex <- as.h2o(iris)
h2o.ls()
```
`h2o.ls()` lists the dataframes you have loaded into H2O. Right now, you should see only one: iris.

Let's start investigating this dataframe. We can get the summary statistics of the various columns:

```{r}
h2o.describe(iris.hex)
```
We can also use H2O to plot histograms:

```{r}
h2o.hist(iris.hex$Sepal.Length)
```

You can use familiar R syntax to modify your H2O dataframe:

```{r}
iris.hex$foo <- iris.hex$Sepal.Length + 2
```

If we now run `h2o.describe(iris.hex)`, we should see this extra variable:

```{r}
h2o.describe(iris.hex)
```

(What I still don't understand is why we don't see this extra column from the Flow UI. If anyone knows, please let me know in the comments!)

But we don't really need this nonsense column, so let's get rid of it:

```{r}
iris.hex$foo <- NULL
```

We can also get our dataframe back into R, from H2O:

```{r}
r_df <- as.data.frame(iris.hex)
```
## 4.3 Building a Model

We've got our H2O instance up and running, with some data in it. Let's go ahead and do some machine learning - let's implement a Random Forest. 

First off, we'll split our data into a training set and a test set. I'm not going to explicitly set a validation set, as the algorithm will use the [out of bag error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-bag_error) instead.

```{r}
splits <- h2o.splitFrame(data = iris.hex,
                         ratios = c(0.8),  #partition data into 80% and 20% chunks
                         seed = 198)

train <- splits[[1]]
test <- splits[[2]]
```
`h2o.splitFrame()` uses approximate splitting. That is, it won't split the data into an exact 80%-20% split. Setting the seed allows us to create reproducible results. 

We can use `h2o.nrow()` to check the number of rows in our train and test sets.

```{r}
print(paste0("Number of rows in train set: ", h2o.nrow(train)))
print(paste0("Number of rows in test set: ", h2o.nrow(test)))
```
Next, let's call `h2o.randomForest()` to create our model:

```{r echo=T, results='hide', message = FALSE}
rf <- h2o.randomForest(x = c("Sepal.Length", "Sepal.Width", "Petal.Length", "Petal.Width"),
                    y = c("Species"),
                    training_frame = train,
                    model_id = "our.rf",
                    seed = 1234)
```
The parameters `x` and `y` specify our independent and dependent variables, respectively. The `training_frame` specified the training set, and `model_id` is the model name, within H2O (not to be confused with variable `rf` in the above code - `rf` is the R handle; whereas `our.rf` is what H2O calls the model). `seed` is used for reproducibility.

We can get the model details simply by printing out the model:

```{r}
print(rf)
```

That seems pretty good. But let's see how the model performs on the test set:


```{r}
rf_perf1 <- h2o.performance(model = rf, newdata = test)
print(rf_perf1)
```

Finally, let's use our model to make some predictions:

```{r, results='hide', message = FALSE}
predictions <- h2o.predict(rf, test)
```
```{r}
print(predictions)
```
