<h1>Inferential vs Descriptive stats.</h1>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive - Purely used to summarize data, like IQR, Mean. Importantly, they do not draw conclusions beyond the data we already have.</li>
<li>Inferential - Does allow us to make conclusions beyond the data we have.</li>
</ul>
<div id="hypothesis-testing" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis Testing</h2>
<p>Inferential statistics is based on the premise that you can’t prove something is true, but you can disprove something by finding an exception.</p>
<p>Decide what you are trying to find evidence for (alternative hypothesis), then set up the opposite as null hypothesis, and find evidence to disprove that.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to show a link between studying and test results.</p>
<ul>
<li>H_0: There is no effect on test result from studying</li>
<li>H_1: There is an effect on test result from studying</li>
</ul>
<p>Hypotheses are always about the population parameters (like the mean).</p>
<p>So the above should be stated mathematically:</p>
<ul>
<li>H_0: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span></li>
<li>H_1: <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> =/= <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span></li>
</ul>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\mu_0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mu_1\)</span> are the means for the “no study” and “study” groups respectively.</p>

<h2>Standardization</h2>
<p>(Example from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uAxyI_XfqXk&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&amp;index=19">here</a>)</p>
<p>How can we compare things that aren’t the same?</p>
<p>Suppose there are two tests: SAT and ACT.</p>
<p>Both try measure college readiness, but SAT is out of 1600 points and ACT is out of 36. How can you compare scores across these 2 tests?</p>
<ul>
<li>Centre both distributions around 0 (subtract the mean) Mean of SAT is 1000, and mean of ACT is 21, so subtract those.</li>
<li>Scales are still wrong, so divide adjusted score by standard deviation</li>
</ul>
<p>This adjusted score is called a Z-Score (see Definitions). <span class="math inline">\(Z = \frac{x - \mu}{\sigma}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note the assumption that both the distribution of SAT and ACT are normally distributed!</p>
</div>
<div id="normal-distribution" class="section level2">
<h2>Normal Distribution</h2>
<p>(Based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rBjft49MAO8&amp;list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&amp;index=20">here</a>)</p>
<p>Normal distribution is important not only because a lot of things are normally distributed, like, height, IQ etc… There are a lot of things like debt, blood pressure which are not normally distributed. But here’s the thing - distributions of means are normally distributed, even if populations aren’t. So, if you sample a lot from a population which is not distributed normally, the mean of those samples will be normally distributed!</p>
<p>In order to meaningfully compare whether two means are different, we need to know something about their distribution: the sampling distribution.</p>
<p>This is described formally in the <strong>Central Limit Theorem</strong> (see definitions).</p>

<p>Now, the mean of the distribution of sample means is the same as the population mean, its standard deviation is not.</p>

<h1>Definitions</h1>
<ul>
<li><u>Central Limit Theorem</u> - The distribution of sample means for an independent random variable will get closer and closer to a normal distribution as the size of the sample gets bigger and bigger, even if the original population distribution isn’t normal. Think of independet die rolls, like in <a href="https://youtu.be/rBjft49MAO8?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNM_Y-bUAhblSAdWRnmBUcr&amp;t=349">here</a>. Twenty dice are 20 independent random variables.</li>
<li><u>Hypthesis Testing</u> -</li>
<li><u>Inference</u> - the process of drawing conclusions about population parameters based on a sample taken from the population.</li>
<li><u>Sampling distribution</u> - the probability distribution of a sample statistic (like the mean, or variance).</li>
<li><u>Type I error</u> - probability of saying null hypothesis is wrong, when it is correct</li>
<li><u>Type II error</u> -</li>
<li><u>Z-Distrubtion</u> - Standardized normal distribution</li>
<li><u>Z-Score</u> - A Z-score is a numerical measurement that describes a value’s relationship to the mean of a group of values. Z-score is measured in terms of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point’s score is identical to the mean score. A Z-score of 1.0 would indicate a value that is one standard deviation from the mean. <strong>Z scores allow us to compare things that are not on the same scale as long as they are normally distributed</strong>.</li>
