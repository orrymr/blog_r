Definition from their Github:
"H2O is an in-memory platform for distributed, scalable machine learning. H2O uses familiar interfaces like R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON and the Flow notebook/web interface, and works seamlessly with big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark."

Or from IBM: "H2O is an open source, in-memory, distributed, fast, and scalable machine learning and predictive analytics platform that allows you to build machine learning models on big data and provides easy productionalization of those models in an enterprise environment."

Install it: http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-xia/2/index.html and click the "INSTALL IN R" tab

R is just a client interfact for H2O. There is also a Python interface. Also, there is Flow (communicates via REST API)

Data is not in R, R only has a pointer to the data.

You use R to send commands to H2O. You could equally just use Flow or Python to send commands.

All clients talk to H2O via a REST API

Since it's just REST based API, when you call an H2O function in R, the function itself does a JSON post to H20

Distributed Frame (15 minutes into the video)

Essentially, when reading in a csv, or data in general, you get back a pointer to the (potentially distributed) h2oFrame

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(h2o)

h2o.init() #Then check it in the browser

data(iris)
View(iris)


iris.hex <- as.h2o(iris)  
h2o.ls()


iris.hex


loan_csv <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/app-consumer-loan/master/data/loan.csv"
data <- h2o.importFile(loan_csv)
