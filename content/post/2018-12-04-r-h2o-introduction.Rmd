Install it: http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-xia/2/index.html and click the "INSTALL IN R" tab, although install.packages("h2o") just worked for me.

R is just a client interfact for H2O. There is also a Python interface. Also, there is Flow (communicates via REST API)

You use R to send commands to H2O. You could equally just use Flow or Python to send commands.

All clients talk to H2O via a REST API

Since it's just REST based API, when you call an H2O function in R, the function itself does a JSON post to H20

Distributed Frame (15 minutes into the video)

Essentially, when reading in a csv, or data in general, you get back a pointer to the (potentially distributed) h2oFrame.

You can view objects created in R, in Python or Flow - it all just connects to the same H2O instance.

So, it seems like when you manipulate an H2O dataframe, even using syntax like you would with a normal df, like  `filtered <- my_df[bleh > 3, ]`, that it is actually doing this on the h2o instance. You send the command to the h2o server.

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(h2o)

h2o.init() #Then check it in the browser
# by default only uses 2 cores
#h2o.init(nthreads = -1) will use all cores

data(iris)
View(iris)


iris.hex <- as.h2o(iris)  
h2o.ls()

h2o.describe(iris.hex)
#Describe the output
h2o.hist(iris.hex$Sepal.Length)

iris.hex$bleh <- iris.hex$Sepal.Length + 2

r_df <- as.data.frame(iris.hex)

```
