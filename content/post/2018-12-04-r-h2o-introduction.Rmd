Install it: http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-xia/2/index.html and click the "INSTALL IN R" tab

R is just a client interfact for H2O. There is also a Python interface. Also, there is Flow (communicates via REST API)

You use R to send commands to H2O. You could equally just use Flow or Python to send commands.

All clients talk to H2O via a REST API

Since it's just REST based API, when you call an H2O function in R, the function itself does a JSON post to H20

Distributed Frame (15 minutes into the video)

Essentially, when reading in a csv, or data in general, you get back a pointer to the (potentially distributed) h2oFrame

```{r}
library(datasets)
library(h2o)

h2o.init() #Then check it in the browser

data(iris)
View(iris)


iris.hex <- as.h2o(iris)  
h2o.ls()


iris.hex


loan_csv <- "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/h2oai/app-consumer-loan/master/data/loan.csv"
data <- h2o.importFile(loan_csv)  



```
