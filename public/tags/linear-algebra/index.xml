      <description>1. Introduction In this article we describe what the nullspace is. We go on to explain how to find the nullspace.
2. Nullspace, Null Space or Kernel? The nullspace (or null space) of a matrix is also known as the kernel of a matrix. These terms are interchangeable.
The nullspace is a set of vectors that when multiplied by a matrix returns $0$ (well, the zero vector).
3. How To Find the Nullspace Have a look at this matrix:</description>

      <description>In my last post we saw how a matrix could operate on a vector to produce a result:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \newline -1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \newline 0 &amp;amp; -1 &amp;amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} % \begin{bmatrix} 1 \newline 4 \newline 9 \end{bmatrix} % &amp;#61; % \begin{bmatrix} 1 \newline 3 \newline 5 \end{bmatrix} \]
The matrix used above is a $3 \times 3$ difference matrix. The general form for this type of operation is:</description>

      <description>One of the most crucial changes in my viewpoint came when I learned that matrices, much like functions, act on inputs. Until then, a matrix was just a collection of numbers and matrix multiplication was just a mechanical set of rules used to produce another collection of numbers. I knew that the result of matrix multiplication could be a scalar, a vector or another matrix&amp;hellip; but I abandoned any further investigations.</description>

      <description>I need a place to document my various ideas as well as the potential results of those ideas.
I also need a place where I can track my progress; that is, progress on a project I may be working on; or progress on material I&amp;rsquo;m busy studying.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try document such things here. I figure, this way, if I commit to something, there will be some evidence of that commitment&amp;hellip; If I see evidence of it I can say: &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, at some point I actually intended to do that!</description>
