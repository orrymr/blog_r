<h1>1. Introduction</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.h2o.ai/">H2O</a> <a href="https://github.com/h2oai/h2o-3">“is an in-memory platform for distributed, scalable machine learning.”</a>. In this post we unpack what this statement means, and get started working with H2O using R.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-h2o" class="section level1">
<h1>2. What is H2O?</h1>
<p>The definition found on H2O’s Github page is a lot to take in, especially if you’re just starting out with H2O (like I am!): “H2O is an in-memory platform for distributed, scalable machine learning. H2O uses familiar interfaces like R, Python, Scala, Java, JSON and the Flow notebook/web interface, and works seamlessly with big data technologies like Hadoop and Spark.”</p>
<p>Let’s break down this statement piece by piece.</p>
<div id="h2o-is-an-in-memory-platform" class="section level2">
<h2>2.1 H2O is an In-Memory Platform</h2>
<p>They start off by telling us that H2O is an “<strong>in-memory platform</strong>”. Saying that it’s in-memory means that the data and software being used is in main memory (RAM). Main memory, or <strong>primary memory</strong> is typically much faster than secondary memory (such as a hard drive). A software platform is typically something which can be used to build something. We happen to know that this platform is used for building machine learning models. Putting this togther we now know that H2O is an in-memory environment for building machine learning models.</p>
</div>
<div id="h2o-is-distributed-and-scalable" class="section level2">
<h2>2.2 H2O is distributed and Scalable</h2>
<p><strong>“…for distributed, scalable machine learning”</strong></p>
<p>H2O runs on clusters. Although I haven’t actually tried this (yet), I’ve read that H2O works on clusters such as Hadoop. It’s something that I still need to experiment with, and when I do, I’ll post a link here. So, for now, I’m just going to interpret the phrase “distributed, scalable machine learning” as saying that we can run the H2O platform on a cluster.</p>
<p>One thing to note, is that H2O uses what’s known as a Distributed Key Value (DKV). You can read more about it <a href="https://www.h2o.ai/blog/h2o-architecture/">here</a>, but essentially what this means, is that any object you create in H2O can be distributed amongst several nodes in the cluster. Of course, if you aren’t using a cluster - and just using a laptop, like I did with the example that follows - you need need to have enough memory to hold your objects locally. Whether you are using a cluster, or running locally, once you’ve imported your data into the H2O platform, you get back a hexadecimal key which you can then use to access your data.</p>
<p>So, <strong>Distributed Key Value</strong>: It’s distributed because your object can be spread amongst several nodes in your cluster. And the key-value part means that you get back a key into what is effectively a hashmap to your object.</p>
<p>DKV:</p>

<div id="running-h2o" class="section level1">
<h1>3. Running H2O</h1>
<p>You can install H2O using R: <code>install.packages(&quot;h2o&quot;)</code>. If you’re having trouble with this, <a href="http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-xia/2/index.html">have a look here.</a></p>
<p>We spoke earlier about H2O being a platform. It’s important to distinguish between the R <strong><em>interface</em></strong> for H2O, and H2O itself. H2O can exist perfectly fine without R. H2O is just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAR_(file_format)">.jar</a> which can run on its own. If you don’t know (or particularly care) what a .jar is - just think of it as a java program packaged with all the stuff it needs to run.</p>
<p>R is just a client interfact for H2O. There is also a Python interface. Also, there is Flow (communicates via REST API)</p>
<p>Data is not in R, R only has a pointer to the data.</p>
<p>You use R to send commands to H2O. You could equally just use Flow or Python to send commands.</p>
<p>All clients talk to H2O via a REST API</p>
<p>Since it’s just REST based API, when you call an H2O function in R, the function itself does a JSON post to H20</p>
<p>Distributed Frame (15 minutes into the video)</p>
<p>Essentially, when reading in a csv, or data in general, you get back a pointer to the (potentially distributed) h2oFrame.</p>
<p>You can view objects created in R, in Python or Flow - it all just connects to the same H2O instance.</p>
<p>So, it seems like when you manipulate an H2O dataframe, even using syntax like you would with a normal df, like <code>filtered &lt;- my_df[bleh &gt; 3, ]</code>, that it is actually doing this on the h2o instance. You send the command to the h2o server.</p>
