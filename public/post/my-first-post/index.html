    <p>I need a place to document my various ideas as well as the potential results of those ideas.</p>

<p>I also need a place where I can track my progress; that is, progress on a project I may be working on; or progress on material I&rsquo;m busy studying.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll try document such things here. I figure, this way, if I commit to something, there will be some evidence of that commitment&hellip; If I see evidence of it I can say: &ldquo;Oh yeah, at some point I actually intended to do that!&rdquo; and it&rsquo;ll be harder for me to back out of that commitment. So really, I&rsquo;m hoping that this blog helps keep me on track with my goals.</p>

<p>Currently, I am busy with <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">MIT&rsquo;s 18.06 course on linear algebra</a>. It&rsquo;s an incredible course presented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilbert_Strang">Gilbert Strang</a>; a man whose passion for mathematics is infectious. As an undergraduate student, I went through the motions of linear algebra mechanically, in order to obtain marks and thus progress to the next year of study. I never really internalized the <em>concepts</em>. This is something which hindered me later in my academic career. I&rsquo;m interested in machine learning and, as with many subjects, linear algebra is a cornerstone. I chose 18.06 because it doesn&rsquo;t spend too much time on proving theorems; rather it aims to convey intuition and understanding by using examples and exposition. Not that proving can&rsquo;t do that, just that it can be difficult to link up those abstract concepts with concrete applications. Maybe I just like Prof Strang&rsquo;s style of teaching. Either way, I&rsquo;ve commited to 18.06 and I&rsquo;ve gone through about 60% of the material. Right now I&rsquo;m on the part of the course which deals with Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors. For the next while, each post will contain something which I find interesting or particularly illuminating about the section of linear algebra I&rsquo;m busy learning. It could be an example, or a concept. Either way, it&rsquo;ll come from the section I&rsquo;m busy with.</p>

<p>My original aim was to complete this course by the end of the 2017 year. But, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll manage to. I&rsquo;m travelling to the US for two weeks at the end of October, and to Cape Town at the end of December. I won&rsquo;t get much done during those periods. I&rsquo;ll give myself til&rsquo; the end of January 2018 to finish up. There it is. I said it. Now there is proof that I said it.</p>

<p>Yikes.</p>
