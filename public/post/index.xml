      <title>An Introduction to H2O Using R</title>
      <link>/post/intro-to-h2o-using-r/</link>

      <description>1. Introduction In this post we discuss the H2O machine learning platform. We talk about what H2O is, and how to get started with it, using R - we create a Random Forest which we use to classify the Iris Dataset.
 2. What is H2O? The definition found on H2O’s Github page is a lot to take in, especially if you’re just starting out with H2O: “H2O is an in-memory platform for distributed, scalable machine learning.</description>

      <title>Inverse Matrices - A Primer</title>

      <description>1. Introduction In this post we talk about the inverse matrix. We discuss what it means for a matrix to be invertible. We then discuss what it means for a matrix not to be invertible - singular. Finally, we briefly go through how to find a matrix&amp;rsquo;s inverse.
2. Invertibility Let&amp;rsquo;s think about a square matrix, $A$. In a previous post we mentioned that a matrix acts on a vector.</description>

      <description>rank of a matrix 10K – 100K Low
The dimension of the column space of a matrix is called its rank. - rank of 1 - when the output of the matrix multiplication is a line (for next article) - rank of 2 - when all the outputs of the matrix mult land in 2-D, then matrix has a rank of 2. - etc&amp;hellip;
It is the number of linearly independent columns</description>

      <title>A Matrix Nullspace (Kernel) Tutorial - Finding the Nullspace</title>

      <description>1. Introduction In this article we describe what the nullspace is. We go on to explain how to find the nullspace.
2. Nullspace, Null Space or Kernel? The nullspace (or null space) of a matrix is also known as the kernel of a matrix. These terms are interchangeable.
The nullspace is a set of vectors that when multiplied by a matrix returns $0$ (well, the zero vector).
3. How To Find the Nullspace Have a look at this matrix:</description>

      <description>In my last post we saw how a matrix could operate on a vector to produce a result:
\[ \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp;amp; 0 &amp;amp; 0 \newline -1 &amp;amp; 1 &amp;amp; 0 \newline 0 &amp;amp; -1 &amp;amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} % \begin{bmatrix} 1 \newline 4 \newline 9 \end{bmatrix} % &amp;#61; % \begin{bmatrix} 1 \newline 3 \newline 5 \end{bmatrix} \]
The matrix used above is a $3 \times 3$ difference matrix. The general form for this type of operation is:</description>

      <description>One of the most crucial changes in my viewpoint came when I learned that matrices, much like functions, act on inputs. Until then, a matrix was just a collection of numbers and matrix multiplication was just a mechanical set of rules used to produce another collection of numbers. I knew that the result of matrix multiplication could be a scalar, a vector or another matrix&amp;hellip; but I abandoned any further investigations.</description>

      <description>I need a place to document my various ideas as well as the potential results of those ideas.
I also need a place where I can track my progress; that is, progress on a project I may be working on; or progress on material I&amp;rsquo;m busy studying.
I&amp;rsquo;ll try document such things here. I figure, this way, if I commit to something, there will be some evidence of that commitment&amp;hellip; If I see evidence of it I can say: &amp;ldquo;Oh yeah, at some point I actually intended to do that!</description>
